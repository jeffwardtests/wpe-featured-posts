## Description

The stakeholders want to be able to get featured posts out of many of our blogs and online magazines so they can put the posts into a widget on the wpengine.com blog. Write a plugin for those WordPress sites that gives the post author a way to mark a post as "Featured on WP Engine's blog" and a way to get the 5 most recent featured posts out of the REST API.

## Installation

1. Upload `wpe-featured-posts.zip` to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Api endpoint: http://your-site-here/wp-json/featured-posts/get/

## Changelog
